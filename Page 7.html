<h3>Soda(Saltine) Crackers</h3>
<hr>
<p>Saltine crackers are among the most preferred kinds of crackers in the world today. Sometimes called a soda or saltina cracker, these thin square shaped crackers are produced using baking soda, shortening, yeast, flour , and coarse salt. Perforations are visible all over the cracker's surface allowing the cracker to break easily. A Saltine cracker has a wonderful salty, crunchy, crispy and dry texture taste that's perfect on its own or when blended with a variety of different foods</p>
<p>The precursor to the modern-day saltine cracker was something known as soda crackers or saltina crackers. These crackers were comparable in size and shape, but had a slightly different taste than present day crackers. It all started in 1792 in the town of Newburyport, Massachusetts, when a business by the name of Pearson and Sons Bakery started baking something called pilot bread, which was comparable to what sailors ate on their ships. Pilot bread was hard and dense, however it was the customarily acknowledged cracker.</p>

<p>Credit for the saltine cracker is attributed to the Josiah Bent Bakery that was located in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The owner of the bakery watched the sales of pilot bread from his competitor Pearson & Sons. In 1801 Josiah Bent decided to create a better tasting cracker that could still be taken on ships and remain fresh as they sailed from port to port. After experimenting with different types of crackers, the bakery finally created a cracker that had a light flavor but was still crisp. These crackers were called soda crackers.</p>
<p>Seventy-five years later in 1876 the very first name brand saltine cracker, "Premium" , was introduced by F. L. Sommer & Company of St. Joseph, Missouri. The Premium brand used the traditional soda cracker recipe that had been developed and mass produced them for the general public. Their soda cracker was shaped into the familiar small square crackers with dusted salt on the top that we are familiar with till this day. Initially called the Premium Soda Cracker and later "Saltines" as a result of the baking salt ingredient, the invention quickly became popular and Sommer's business quadrupled within four years. The company was best known for their slogan, "Polly wants a cracker?" which ran in advertisements and on saltine cracker boxes. That company merged with other companies to form the American Biscuit Company in 1890 which then became after further mergers part of Nabisco in 1898. The continued use by Nabisco of the phrase "Polly wants a cracker?" made the saltine cracker famous and this slogan has become part of our everyday lexicon.</p>
