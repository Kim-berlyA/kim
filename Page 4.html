	<h3>Cream Crackers</h3>
	<hr>
	<p> A cream cracker is a flat, usually square, savoury biscuit. The name "cream crackers" refers to the method in which the mixture is creamed during manufacture. The cream cracker is traditionally prepared using fermented dough.</p>
    <p> They are made from wheat flour, vegetable oil and yeast, and are commonly served with cheese,[2] corned beef or other savoury topping such as Marmite or Vegemite. They are also eaten with butter or margarine or without accompaniment.</p>
    <p> The cream cracker was invented by Joseph Haughton at his home in Dublin, Ireland, and then manufactured by William Jacob in a small bakery around 1885.</p>
